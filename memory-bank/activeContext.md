# Active Context: SeekerAug

## Current Work Focus

- Completing the initial setup for SeekerAug: project structure, backend skeleton, and documentation.
- Preparing for frontend (React) and backend (Python) integration and further module development.

## Recent Changes

- Ingested the full PRD from Docs/sdat.md.
- Created core Memory Bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md.
- Populated each file with synthesized, project-specific content.
- Scaffolded the initial project directory structure (src/main, src/renderer, src/python, src/shared, assets/icons).
- Created package.json and .gitignore.
- Set up Electron main process (src/main/index.js), renderer HTML (src/renderer/index.html), and Python backend skeleton (src/python/api.py).

## Next Steps

- Set up the React frontend entry point and initial App component.
- Add development tooling (Webpack, TypeScript config, etc.).
- Implement the Electron-Python communication bridge.
- Begin developing core modules (dataset management, annotation, augmentation, training, export).
- Continue to document progress and update the Memory Bank as implementation proceeds.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Strictly following the PRD for architecture, technology choices, and workflow.
- All implementation and documentation will be kept in sync via the Memory Bank.
- Initial development targets Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) with .deb packaging.
- All user data and computation will remain local, with no cloud dependencies.
