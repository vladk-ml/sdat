# Product Context: SeekerAug

## Why This Project Exists

SeekerAug is designed to address the need for a comprehensive, privacy-focused, and cost-effective computer vision development suite that runs entirely on the user's local machine. Existing solutions like Roboflow are cloud-based, which can introduce privacy concerns, recurring costs, and limitations for users with powerful local hardware.

## Problems Solved

- Eliminates the need to upload sensitive data to the cloud, ensuring data privacy and compliance.
- Reduces operational costs by leveraging local compute resources, including GPUs.
- Provides a unified workflow for dataset management, annotation, augmentation, and model training.
- Enables organizations and individuals with limited or no access to cloud services to perform advanced computer vision tasks.
- Simplifies the setup and management of computer vision projects for both individuals and teams.

## How It Should Work

- Users interact with a modern, desktop application (Electron + React) that guides them through the entire computer vision workflow.
- All data (images, annotations, models) is stored and processed locally.
- The application abstracts away file system complexity, presenting users with logical project and dataset views.
- Projects are fully isolated, with their own raw and refined datasets, history, and metadata.
- Raw dataset: original files (jpg, png, tif, etc.) are imported and preserved.
- Refined dataset: all raw images can be processed to high-quality JPGs, with metadata (dimensions, format, TIFF tags, geospatial info) extracted and stored.
- Dataset history: all additions/removals to the raw dataset are logged in a per-project audit trail, viewable in the UI.
- Real-time and background saving mechanisms ensure no work is lost.
- The backend (Python) handles all heavy computation, including annotation assistance, augmentation, and model training, with GPU acceleration when available.
- Communication between frontend and backend is seamless, using REST APIs, WebSockets, and ZeroMQ for high-performance tasks.

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing UI with clear navigation and workflow guidance.
- Consistent layout: top bar for global actions, main content area for dataset/tools, context menus, and command palette for power users.
- Immediate feedback for user actions (e.g., saving status, progress indicators).
- Easy project creation, management, and switching, with a professional, information-dense, VS Code-like experience.
- Wide, responsive image grid with original filenames, metadata, and audit/history panel.
- Smooth transitions between workflow stages: collection → processing → annotation → augmentation → training.
- Flexible import/export options for interoperability with other tools and formats.
- Robust error handling and clear diagnostic messages.
- Full traceability: every dataset change is logged and inspectable.

## User Personas

- Researchers and developers needing local, high-performance computer vision workflows.
- Organizations with strict privacy requirements.
- Educators and students learning computer vision.
- Teams with shared local resources and collaborative workflows.
- Users working with scientific, geospatial, or large-scale imagery who require advanced metadata and auditability.
