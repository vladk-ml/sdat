# Project Brief: SeekerAug

## Project Name
SeekerAug: Local Computer Vision Development Suite

## Vision
SeekerAug provides a complete, locally-run computer vision development environment that mimics the Roboflow workflow but operates entirely on the user's machine. It offers enhanced privacy, reduced costs, and compatibility with local GPU acceleration.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- End-to-end workflow for computer vision projects: from dataset management and annotation to augmentation and model training.
- All operations are performed locally, with no cloud dependencies.
- Support for GPU acceleration and hardware detection.
- User-friendly desktop application with a modern UI.
- Dataset versioning, annotation (manual and AI-assisted), augmentation, and model training/export.
- Flexible export options for datasets and models.
- Robust, extensible architecture for future expansion (multi-GPU, distributed training, platform support).

## Target Users

- Computer vision researchers and developers
- Organizations with privacy requirements
- Educational institutions
- Developers with limited cloud budgets
- Teams with local GPU resources

## Out of Scope

- Cloud-based processing or storage
- Web-based user interface (local desktop app only)
- Proprietary model training frameworks (focus on open-source)

## Source of Truth

This document defines the core scope, requirements, and goals for the SeekerAug project. All subsequent documentation and implementation should align with this brief.
