# Progress: SeekerAug

## What Works

- Projects are fully isolated: each has its own directory, database, and raw/processed datasets.
- Raw dataset workflow: import of images (jpg, png, tif, etc.) with original filenames preserved.
- Refined dataset workflow: all raw images can be processed to high-quality JPGs, with metadata (dimensions, format, TIFF tags, etc.) extracted and stored.
- Dataset history: all additions/removals to the raw dataset are logged in a per-project audit trail, viewable in the UI.
- Wide, responsive image grid with original filenames, metadata, and professional UI/UX.
- Main application window structure scaffolded: persistent explorer pane, centered command bar with command palette button, tabbed workspace, context panel, and status bar.
- Explorer Pane implemented: shows dataset types (Raw, Refined, Annotated, Augmented) with color-coded badges and action buttons (open in file explorer, export).
- Command Palette button is centered in the top bar; modal overlay is centered on screen.
- "New Project" modal and logic restored; users can create new projects from the welcome screen.
- Workspace now displays a dashboard with the project name and welcome message after opening a project.
- Command Palette closes on command.
- Immediate import for empty projects; staged import for non-empty projects.
- Backend endpoints for all major operations, with strict project scoping.
- Command palette, context menus, and VS Code-like navigation.
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) local-only operation, no cloud dependencies.

## What's Left to Build

- Annotation workflow: annotation UI, backend endpoints, and storage (COCO, YOLO, etc.).
- Augmentation pipeline: UI for building augmentation steps, backend for applying them, and visualization of augmented data.
- Model training integration: training config UI, backend job management, and training dashboard.
- Advanced metadata: support for geospatial/scale info, especially for scientific/aerial imagery.
- Dataset/annotation versioning and diff tools.
- Further UI/UX refinements for dense, information-rich, and professional experience.
- Collaborative features (multi-client, P2P, real-time sync) [future].
- GPU detection and environment setup.
- Packaging and deployment scripts.
- Documentation and testing infrastructure.
- Usage management system for images/annotations (used/unused marking, batch operations, inheritance rules, usage management UI).
- Lineage visualization: interactive graph/timeline of dataset and annotation relationships, with branching and filtering.
- Annotation history: timeline of changes, revert/compare, audit trail.
- Augmentation pipeline builder: drag-and-drop steps, parameter adjustment, save/load pipelines, real-time preview.
- Batch operations: copy annotations, multi-select, bulk editing, batch verification.
- Review/approval workflows: comment on annotations, mark for review, approval, quality metrics.
- Workspace customization: resizable panels, snap-to guides, layout presets, theme and shortcut customization.
- Keyboard shortcuts for all major actions (VS Code-inspired).
- Export enhancements: preview, format selection, progress indicators, export selected items, support for multiple annotation/model formats.

## Current Status

- Core project and dataset management workflows are complete and robust.
- Raw/refined dataset pipeline, metadata extraction, and dataset history are implemented and fully functional.
- UI/UX is professional, responsive, and optimized for workstation use.
- Ready to proceed with annotation, augmentation, and training modules.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues at this stage.
- Further testing needed for large datasets and edge cases (e.g., very large TIFFs, unusual metadata).
- Collaborative and advanced features are planned for future phases.
