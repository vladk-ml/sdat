# Progress: SeekerAug (Memory Bank Update, 2025-04-28)

## What Works

- Projects are fully isolated: each has its own directory, database, and raw/refined datasets.
- Project management (list, create, delete) is robust and handled via the Flask backend API.
- Welcome Page and Project Dashboard are fully integrated with backend persistence and provide a professional, VS Code-inspired experience.
- **Raw dataset workflow:** 
  - Import of images (jpg, png, tif, etc.) with original filenames preserved in the raw directory.
  - All metadata (unique ID, original filename, current filename, import time) is tracked in a central `raw_metadata.json` file.
  - Renaming in the UI updates the metadata file, not the file on disk.
  - Grid view and explorer use metadata for display and management.
- **Refined dataset workflow:**
  - Intake process ("Ingest to Refined Dataset") copies images from raw to refined, standardizes format, extracts metadata, and creates per-image annotation files.
  - Per-image annotation files (JSON/YAML) in the refined directory contain all extracted metadata, lineage, and an empty annotation list.
- **Explorer Pane:** Shows both "Raw Dataset" and "Refined Dataset" entries, each opening their respective grid views.
- **Tab System:** Tabs are opened for each dataset type, with stateful management.
- **Ingest Button:** The grid view for the raw dataset includes an "Ingest to Refined Dataset" button to trigger the intake process.
- **Backend API:** 
  - `/raw/metadata` serves the contents of `raw_metadata.json`.
  - `/dataset/intake` triggers the intake process to the refined dataset.
  - All renaming and display logic for raw images is metadata-driven.
- **UI/UX:** Professional, responsive, and optimized for workstation use.

## What's Left to Build

- Complete the grid view and management UI for the refined dataset, using per-image annotation files.
- Implement robust error handling and UI feedback for all dataset operations.
- Continue to refine the explorer and tab system for seamless navigation between dataset types.
- Plan and implement annotation workflows and augmentation pipeline integration.
- Add batch operations, export/import, and advanced metadata/lineage features.

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in project creation (duplicate names, manual deletion) may cause inconsistent state; further robustness needed.
- Refined dataset grid view and annotation management are pending full implementation.
- Further testing needed for large datasets and edge cases (e.g., very large TIFFs, unusual metadata).
- Collaborative and advanced features are planned for future phases.

## Next Steps

1. Implement grid view and management UI for the refined dataset, using per-image annotation files.
2. Add error handling and UI feedback for all dataset operations.
3. Refine explorer and tab system for seamless navigation.
4. Plan and implement annotation workflows and augmentation pipeline integration.
5. Test with real datasets and edge cases.
