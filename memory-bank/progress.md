# Progress: SeekerAug

## What Works

- Projects are fully isolated: each has its own directory, database, and raw/processed datasets.
- Raw dataset workflow: import of images (jpg, png, tif, etc.) with original filenames preserved.
- Refined dataset workflow: all raw images can be processed to high-quality JPGs, with metadata (dimensions, format, TIFF tags, etc.) extracted and stored.
- Dataset history: all additions/removals to the raw dataset are logged in a per-project audit trail, viewable in the UI.
- Wide, responsive image grid with original filenames, metadata, and professional UI/UX.
- Main application window structure scaffolded: persistent explorer pane, centered command bar with command palette button, tabbed workspace, context panel, and status bar.
- Explorer Pane implemented: shows dataset types (Raw, Refined, Annotated, Augmented) with color-coded badges and action buttons (open in file explorer, export).
- Command Palette button is centered in the top bar; modal overlay is centered on screen.
- "New Project" modal and logic restored; users can create new projects from the welcome screen.
- Workspace now displays a dashboard with the project name and welcome message after opening a project.
- Command Palette closes on command.
- Immediate import for empty projects; staged import for non-empty projects.
- Backend endpoints for all major operations, with strict project scoping.
- Command palette, context menus, and VS Code-like navigation.
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) local-only operation, no cloud dependencies.

## What's Left to Build

**Reference:** See "UI/UX Scaffold & Feature Roadmap (2025-04-21)" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for the authoritative, detailed roadmap.

**Incremental, Testable Implementation Steps:**
1. Finalize UI scaffold (all panes, bars, panels, resizable).
2. Implement tab system (basic open/close, types, state).
3. Explorer integration (dataset actions to tabs/context).
4. Context panel (context-sensitive logic, metadata).
5. Status bar (project info, operation status, notifications).
6. Command bar & palette (global actions, palette, navigation).
7. Navigation (forward/back, tab history, state restoration).
8. Dataset operations (import, process, annotate, augment, train, export).
9. Annotation/augmentation workflows (UI, backend).
10. Lineage/versioning (usage marking, visualization, history).
11. Shortcuts/customization (keyboard, workspace).
12. Testing & regression prevention (tests, validation).

## Current Status

- Core project and dataset management workflows are complete and robust.
- Raw/refined dataset pipeline, metadata extraction, and dataset history are implemented and fully functional.
- UI/UX is professional, responsive, and optimized for workstation use.
- **Planning phase complete:** Authoritative scaffold and feature roadmap established. Ready to proceed with incremental scaffold implementation as outlined above.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues at this stage.
- Further testing needed for large datasets and edge cases (e.g., very large TIFFs, unusual metadata).
- Collaborative and advanced features are planned for future phases.
