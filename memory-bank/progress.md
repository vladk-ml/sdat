Progress: SeekerAug

## What Works

- Projects are fully isolated: each has its own directory, database, and raw/processed datasets.
- Project management (list, create, delete) is fully persistent and handled via the Flask backend API; no localStorage/in-memory logic remains.
- Welcome Page and Project Dashboard are fully integrated with backend persistence and provide a professional, VS Code-inspired experience.
- Raw dataset workflow: import of images (jpg, png, tif, etc.) with original filenames preserved.
- Refined dataset workflow: all raw images can be processed to high-quality JPGs, with metadata (dimensions, format, TIFF tags, etc.) extracted and stored.
- Dataset history: all additions/removals to the raw dataset are logged in a per-project audit trail, viewable in the UI.
- Wide, responsive image grid with original filenames, metadata, and professional UI/UX.
- Main application window structure scaffolded: persistent explorer pane, centered command bar with command palette button, tabbed workspace, context panel, and status bar.
- Explorer Pane implemented: shows dataset types (Raw, Refined, Annotated, Augmented) with color-coded badges and action buttons (open in file explorer, export).
- Command Palette button is centered in the top bar; modal overlay is centered on screen.
- "New Project" modal and logic restored; users can create new projects from the welcome screen.
- Workspace now displays a dashboard with the project name and welcome message after opening a project.
- Command Palette closes on command.
- Immediate import for empty projects; staged import for non-empty projects.
- Backend endpoints for all major operations, with strict project scoping.
- Command palette, context menus, and VS Code-like navigation.
- **Theming:** VS Code-style theming system implemented using JSON theme files and a dynamic loader (moved to `index.jsx`). Most UI elements use theme variables. Sidebar header/icon colors fixed using CSS classes.
- **Tab System Foundation:** Core state management, tab bar rendering, open/close/select logic, and automatic dashboard tab opening are functional.
- **Basic Resizable Panes:** Sidebar and context panel can be resized via drag handles, minimize when dragged small, and be restored via icon click. Collapse icons (using `span` elements) added to pane headers for instant minimizing.
- **Raw Image Import:** Import via button click and file dialog is functional (backend API expects `File` objects via `FormData`). Minor issues might exist but are shelved.
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) local-only operation, no cloud dependencies.

## What's Left to Build

**Reference:** See "UI/UX Scaffold & Feature Roadmap (2025-04-21)" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for the authoritative, detailed roadmap.

**Incremental, Testable Implementation Steps:**
1. Finalize UI scaffold (all panes, bars, panels, resizable).
2. Implement tab system (basic open/close, types, state).
3. Explorer integration (dataset actions to tabs/context).
4. Context panel (context-sensitive logic, metadata).
5. Status bar (project info, operation status, notifications).
6. Command bar & palette (global actions, palette, navigation).
7. Navigation (forward/back, tab history, state restoration).
8. Dataset operations (import, process, annotate, augment, train, export).
9. Annotation/augmentation workflows (UI, backend).
10. Lineage/versioning (usage marking, visualization, history).
11. Shortcuts/customization (keyboard, workspace).
12. Testing & regression prevention (tests, validation).

## Current Status

- Core project and dataset management workflows are complete and robust, with all persistence handled by the Flask backend API.
- Welcome Page and Project Dashboard are fully integrated with backend persistence and provide a professional, VS Code-inspired experience.
- Theming is handled via JSON theme files and dynamic CSS variable injection, matching VS Code's approach.
- Raw/refined dataset pipeline, metadata extraction, and dataset history are implemented and fully functional.
- UI/UX is professional, responsive, and optimized for workstation use.
- **Tab system and resizable panes implemented:** Core functionality for the VS Code-style layout (Explorer, Tabbed Workspace, Context Panel) is in place and functional, including basic resizing, tab management, and header collapse icons (using `span`s). Crashes related to tab closing and project opening have been resolved.
- **Raw image import functional:** Users can import images using the "Import Images" button.

## Known Issues

- **Styling (Shelved):** Context Panel placeholder text (`[Context Panel Placeholder]`) remains black despite extensive troubleshooting, including increasing CSS specificity, applying inline styles with and without `!important`, and hardcoding color values. DevTools confirm styles are applied, but the computed color remains black. The root cause is unknown and the issue is shelved for now.
- Resizable panes lack persistence (widths and minimized state are not saved).
- Explorer and Context Panel content is placeholder.
- Only 'dashboard' tab type is implemented; other types (grid view, image viewer) need rendering logic.
- Further testing needed for large datasets and edge cases (e.g., very large TIFFs, unusual metadata).
- Collaborative and advanced features are planned for future phases.

## April 29, 2025: Recovery & Codebase Integrity Review

### Context
- Performed a full review of all changes between the last good commit and the "fixing garbage" commit, as well as the current state of the main and recovery-fresh branches.
- Used CLI tools to compare line-by-line additions, focusing on meaningful source code and excluding build artifacts.

### Key Findings
- Most changes in the "fixing garbage" commit and related LLM-generated commits were destructive (removals, overwrites, or regressions).
- The only positive, progressive change found and kept was the addition of the CopyWebpackPlugin config for theme support in webpack.renderer.config.js, and the move of dark.json to the themes/ directory.
- All valuable features, documentation, and UI logic were preserved in the recovery-fresh branch.
- Build artifacts (renderer.js, renderer.js.map) were excluded from all reviews and merges.

### Actions Taken
- Restored and committed annotation-schema.md and AnnotationEditor.jsx to preserve documentation and features.
- Kept all current, working versions of source files (App.jsx, ImageGrid.jsx, projectApi.js, etc.) in recovery-fresh.
- Ensured package.json and package-lock.json were kept as-is, as they only contained dependency changes.
- Verified that all positive progress is present in recovery-fresh, and all destructive edits are excluded.
- Documented the CLI commands used for future reference:
  - `git diff main recovery-fresh --unified=0 --diff-filter=AM | grep '^+[^+]'` (shows new lines, excluding build artifacts)
  - Exclude build artifacts with: `-- ':!src/renderer/renderer.js' ':!src/renderer/renderer.js.map'`

### Lessons Learned
- LLM-generated changes can be highly destructive if not guided by a strong memory bank and clear context.
- Always work from a known good commit and cherry-pick only clear, positive changes.
- Maintain a strong Memory Bank and document every feature, pattern, and workflow.
- Exclude build artifacts from version control and code reviews.

### Next Steps
- Continue incremental, testable implementation as outlined in the feature roadmap.
- Use the Memory Bank as the single source of truth for all future work and recovery efforts.
- Update .clinerules with project intelligence and workflow patterns as they are discovered.

## April 30, 2025: Cline Code Extraction & Backend Recovery

- Successfully extracted and appended all positive Cline-generated logic from the "fixing garbage" commit to the following backend Python files:
  - api.py: Restored dataset intake, annotation CRUD, and raw metadata endpoints.
  - importer.py: Appended logic to maintain a central raw_metadata.json file for all imported images.
  - processor.py: Appended logic to create per-image annotation/metadata files in the processed directory.
  - image_ops.py: Integrated metadata-driven image renaming, updating raw_metadata.json and the database.
- Used algorithmic git diff commands to identify and recover missing code blocks, ensuring only positive, non-destructive logic was restored.
- All changes were made in an append-only, non-destructive manner, preserving existing working code and workflows.
- Memory Bank and annotation-schema.md were referenced to ensure all restored logic matches intended data flow and schema.
- Next: Review and extract any remaining Cline-generated code from non-Python files (e.g., frontend JS/JSX, projectApi.js, etc.).
