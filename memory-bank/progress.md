# Progress: SeekerAug

## What Works

- Memory Bank is fully established with all core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md).
- Product requirements and architecture have been ingested from Docs/sdat.md and documented.
- Initial project directory structure created (src/main, src/renderer, src/python, src/shared, assets/icons).
- package.json and .gitignore initialized.
- Electron main process (src/main/index.js) and renderer HTML (src/renderer/index.html) created.
- Python backend skeleton (src/python/api.py) with health check endpoint is in place.

## What's Left to Build

- Set up the React frontend entry point and initial App component.
- Add development tooling (Webpack, TypeScript config, etc.).
- Implement the Electron-Python communication bridge.
- Develop core modules: dataset management, annotation, augmentation, training, export.
- Build out the user interface and workflow components.
- Integrate GPU detection and environment setup.
- Implement packaging and deployment scripts.
- Add documentation and testing infrastructure.

## Current Status

- Documentation and context are complete.
- Initial project scaffolding and backend skeleton are in place.
- Ready to proceed with frontend setup and further development.

## Known Issues

- None at this stage. Issues will be tracked here as development progresses.
