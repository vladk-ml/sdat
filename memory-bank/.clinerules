## UI/UX Implementation Reference

- When implementing or refactoring UI/UX components, optionally reference `memory-bank/vscode-ui-patterns.md` for actionable design notes, code snippets, and implementation hints derived from VS Code analysis.
- Only read the relevant lines/sections of this file as needed for the current task, to avoid unnecessary token usage.
- Use this file for practical details on tab bar, sidebar, context panel, status bar, layout, theming, keyboard shortcuts, and general UI patterns.
- Update this file with new patterns, snippets, and hints as they are discovered.

## General Rules

- Always keep the Memory Bank up to date with all major design decisions, patterns, and implementation notes.
- Reference systemPatterns.md for canonical architecture and design rules.
- Reference activeContext.md for current work focus, next steps, and recent changes.
- Use progress.md to track what works, what's left, and current status.
- Use productContext.md and projectbrief.md for product vision and requirements.
- Use techContext.md for technology stack, setup, and constraints.
